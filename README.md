ChromaShift is a web-based tool that allows users to easily generate custom gradient palettes for use in their design projects. With ChromaShift, users can select two colors to be used in the gradient, as well as choose how many colors they want in the palette (up to 15 colors). 

The tool displays the hex codes for each color on the screen. When clicked, the color is automatically copied, making it easy to copy and paste. Additionally, users can generate a random palette with both colors having at least a slight contrast.
